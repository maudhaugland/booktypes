Intro

*Other Worlds: Peasants, Pilgrims, Spirits, Saints* is a collection of short stories written by a Russian woman called Teffi. They were origianlly published between 1916 and 1952 and enjoyed by both Tsar Nicholas II and Lenin alike. In 2021 they were finally translated into English and published by Pushkin Press in this short story collection. 



I'd say that the first association that springs to mind when I see this cover is Russia. Partly because of all the red, the vintage vibe and the distinctively Eastern European roof on the house with chicken legs (a reference to an old Russian fairy tale). However, the typography chosen for the title of this cover has undoubtedly a major part in it as well. 

Very tall and condensed, bold, capitals, slopes upwards
