*Reputation* by Lex Croucher is a historical fiction published in 2021 by Zafre. It's said to be a mix of *Mean Girls* and Jane Austen, a romcom from the Regency-era with great friendships and drunken nights out, perfect for fans of the giant Netflix hit, *Bridgerton*. 

As you can see on the photo above, the title on Reputation is quite bold and rather unexpected. It's very "in your face". It really stands out among the swirly Sript typefaces of the historical fiction genre, especially those who are also categorised as "women's fiction".

## Bold and modern

Reputation is a historical fiction novel written for the Gen-Z and Millennials, not middle aged people and grandmas (though that depends on your grandma, of course). This is really reflected in the typeface on the cover. It kind of reminds me of a streetwear fashion brand or even the logo of a toothpaste company. 

The typeface is modern, with low contrasted letters in a slightly leaning itallic font. It's similar to the popular Swiss typeface, Helvetica, although the capital "I" does have serifs on this cover.
