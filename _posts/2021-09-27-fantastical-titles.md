**The title of a book can tell you a lot** about the content between the covers, but have you thought about how much the design of the words and letters actually matter? You will most probably judge a book by its typography as well as its overall cover design. In fact, I would say it's a very important factor in many cases. It can be bold, it can be beautiful, it can be weird and it can be almost invisible.

## The title's typographic secrets

My edition was published by Virago in 2015, as part of their modern classics series. They say that one should never judge a book by its cover, but I have to admit that the cover design was one of the main reasons why I decided to buy this book. Fortunately, I enjoyed the story on the inside too. 

It really looks like the title of the book, in this case *Rebecca*, is integrated in the overall design. You almost have to look a bit closer to see that it is in fact the title and not just a part of the decoration. This is actually quite clever as the character that gave her name to the title is not actually present in the book, just a ghost haunting every page and scene. In a way, she is a part of the background, almost invisible until you notice her and then you can never unsee or forget her again. Just like the title. 

The designer chose a very swirly, elegant and romantic font for the title. It has no sharp edges whatsoever, and it looks like each letter is formed after the same oblong circle, written out using a golden ribbon. The thin lines look almost fragile and timid, like the letters would break if you aren't careful enough. The font manages to look luxurious and fancy while still being sans serif and low contrast, which is the opposite of what especially more serious high brow brands like to use. 

Perhaps the font conveys the luxury by simply looking like it is handwritten. And not written by a child, but by someone who uses calligraphy to write beautiful letters to friends and acquaintances, inviting them to grandiose dinner parties. It looks old fashioned, and rich. 



### A Gothic modern classic

I would say that the script-like typography we find on the cover of *Rebecca* is a typeface we usually associate with historical fiction and romance novels. The association to letterwriting is probably a big reason for that. But is Rebecca a romantic historical novel? Well, sort of. There is a romance and it is a book from the 1930s set on a grand estate in Cornwall, but the story is much darker than the font on its own would have been able to convey, with ghosts and murder and a little bit of madness. 

However, when you look at the cover as a whole, the romantic font of the title does contribute to give the onlooker an eerie feeling that something is not quite right, whithout knowing exactly what. Something dark is lurking under the surface. Perhaps it's how the blood red flowers grab your attention, almost as if to distract you from the real threat that is the title in the background. 

Rebecca is usually classified as a Gothic modern classic. But what does that mean? Well, it means that it was written and published after 1900 for a start. So "modern" in this context basically means in the last century, which a lot of people wouldn't think was that modern at all. I mean, if a computer is more than ten years old it is practically ancient. Luckily, books can have a much longer life span. And as it is a classic it has been read and loved over and over again from the year it was published until this day. Therefore it is not surprising that the title looks a bit old fashioned, as "old" basically is its genre: classics. 

The Gothic element means that the book probably has ghosts or something other dark and at least slightly superntural force or creature in it, which makes it spooky and dramatic. Think of *Dracula*, *Wuthering Heights* or *Frankenstein*.

### Rebecca through history

This is not the first nor the last edition of Rebecca. As a classic first published in 1938 by Gollancz, it has gotten renewed covers and editions several times up through the decades. The very first edition had a lemon yellow cover with pinkish purple title in a very high contrast, blocky, and a bit condenced font with serifs. It does have a vintage feel to it, especially with the high contrast, and it was probably a popular font at the time. It's the sort of font that you would imagine being in really old black and white Hollywood films or on advertisements in the 1930s. 

Interestingly enough, the newest edition of Rebecca published by Virago, the Netflix tie-in movie poster cover, actually uses the exact same font as the first edition. This is perhaps an attemt to give it a vintage feel as the movie poster is very bright and clearly new. You can almost see Netflix oozing out of it. 

Another edition of Rebecca, also published by Virago like my edition, has a title with much stronger gothic associations as the font is closer to the original Blackletter font, also called Gothic Script. This font is also popular with rock bands nowadays, which is a big contrast to the romantic script font of my edition.
