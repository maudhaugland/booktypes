Intro

*The Guest Cat* can sound like a book for children, but the font tells us that it is definitely not. 

Description

Associations - quiet, calm, serious, intellectual, 

Literary translated fiction - serious, high-brow, high contrast, serifs, intellectual  

Japanese lit - usually without serifs, ultra modern, futuristic, robots and neon lights, but also cherry blossoms and lazy cats in suburbs, Haruki Murakami,
