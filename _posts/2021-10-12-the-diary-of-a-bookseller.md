How can a book cover look intimate and personal when it is made to sell thousands, or perhaps even millions, of copies?

### Personal?

*The Diary of a Bookseller* by Shaun Bythell was published by Profile Books in 2017. It is the author's diary about, you might have guessed it, working as a bookseller. The bookshop is located in Wigtown, Scotland, and it is still open, so you can go and visit if you happen to be nearby one day. It is said to be 'warm, witty and laugh-out-loud funny' if one should trust the words of the *Daily Mail*. 

The title looks like its written with a marker pen. It's condensed, but the tracking, space between the letters, makes it look airy. Furthermore, it's all written in capital letters. It kind of reminds me of the posters we made in school, but this is of course a bit nicer and less lopsided. Rather charming. 

I think the marker like font is chosen because it's very casual and not at all intimidating. It's meant to look cosy and informal. Other memoirs about famous people or nonfiction books in general are often supposed to look much more serious and intimidating, and the designers have made a proper effort to avoid this. 

At the same time, it is clear that the title isn't *actually* just written out with a marker pen. If you look a bit closer, you can see that all the letters are all corresponding. So all the "B"s are exactly the same, for example ***XXXX***

### Diaries

The Diary of a Bookseller is categorised as a memoir by the publisher. Perhaps because once it is published and for the public to read, it ceases to be a diary as we know it although it was its original form. Nonetheless, it is a real story about a real man in a real bookshop, and it is *his* story. 

*The Diary of a Young Girl* by Anne Frank is probaby the most famous published diary of the past century. Even though the themes are much darker, as expected of a story from the second world war, it is still in the same genre as *The Diary of a Bookseller* as it is an edited, published diary. As Anne Frank's Diary was published in 1947, it has been reprinted and republished in multiple editions throughout the decades, so I'm just going to talk about the one I find to fit the diary genre the best.
