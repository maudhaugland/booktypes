How can a book cover look intimate and personal when it is made to sell thousands, or perhaps even millions, of copies?

### Personal?

*The Diary of a Bookseller* by Shaun Bythell was published by Profile Books in 2017. It is the author's diary about, you might have guessed it, working as a bookseller. The bookshop is located in Wigtown, Scotland, and it is still open, so you can go and visit if you happen to be nearby one day. It is said to be 'warm, witty and laugh-out-loud funny' if one should trust the words of the *Daily Mail*. 

The typeface of the title looks almsot like its written with a marker pen - condenced, but spaced, capitals, - like the posters you made in school - rather charming

### Diaries

Genre - Diary, non-fiction, personal story

*The Diary of a Young Girl* by Anne Frank is probaby the most famous published diary of the past century. Even though the tone is much darker, as expected of a story from the second world war, it is still in the same genre as *The Diary of a Bookseller* as it is an edited, published diary. SAMMENLGN
