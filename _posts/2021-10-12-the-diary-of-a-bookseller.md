Introduction

Description

Genre - Diary, non-fiction, personal story

*The Diary of a Young Girl* by Anne Frank is probaby the most famous published diary of the past century. Even though the tone is much darker, as expected of a story from the second world war, it is still in the same genre as *The Diary of a Bookseller* as it is an edited diary. SAMMENLGN
