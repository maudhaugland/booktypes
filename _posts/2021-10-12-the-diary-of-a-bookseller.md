How can a book cover look intimate and personal when it is made to sell thousands, or perhaps even millions, of copies?

### Personal?

*The Diary of a Bookseller* by Shaun Bythell was published by Profile Books in 2017. It is the author's diary about, you might have guessed it, working as a bookseller in a small bookshop in Wigtown, Scotland. It is said to be 'warm, witty and laugh-out-loud funny' if one should trust the words of the *Daily Mail*. 

The typeface of the title looks almsot like its written with a marker pen - condenced, but spaced, capitals, - like the posters you made in school - rather charming  

### Diaries 

Genre - Diary, non-fiction, personal story

*The Diary of a Young Girl* by Anne Frank is probaby the most famous published diary of the past century. Even though the tone is much darker, as expected of a story from the second world war, it is still in the same genre as *The Diary of a Bookseller* as it is an edited, published diary. SAMMENLGN
