How can a book cover look intimate and personal when it is made to sell thousands, or perhaps even millions, of copies?

### Personal?

*The Diary of a Bookseller* by Shaun Bythell was published by Profile Books in 2017. It is the author's diary about, you might have guessed it, working as a bookseller. The bookshop is located in Wigtown, Scotland, and it is still open, so you can go and visit if you happen to be nearby one day. It is said to be 'warm, witty and laugh-out-loud funny' if one should trust the words of the *Daily Mail*. 

The title looks like its written with a marker pen. It's condensed, but the tracking, space between the letters, makes it look airy even though the font itself is quite heavy. Furthermore, it's all written in capital letters. It kind of reminds me of the posters we made in school, but this is of course a bit nicer and less lopsided. Rather charming. 

I think the marker like font is chosen because it's very casual and not at all intimidating. It's meant to look cosy and informal. Other memoirs about famous people or nonfiction books in general are often supposed to look much more serious and intimidating, and the designers have made a proper effort to avoid this. 

At the same time, it is clear that the title isn't *actually* just written out with a marker pen. If you look a bit closer, you can see that all the letters are all corresponding. So for example, all the "O"s are exactly the same with the little dent in the right side to make them seem imperfect and add to the casualness. But it's a uniform imperfection which makes it more interesting as it shows thst the font itself is designed to be that way.

### Diaries

*The Diary of a Bookseller* is categorised as a memoir by the publisher. Perhaps because once it is published and for the public to read, it ceases to be a diary as we know it although it was its original form. Nonetheless, it is a real story about a real man in a real bookshop, and it is *his* story. 

*The Diary of a Young Girl* by Anne Frank is probaby the most famous published diary of the past century. Even though the themes are much darker, as expected of a story from the second world war, it is still in the same genre as *The Diary of a Bookseller* as it is an edited, published diary. As Anne Frank's Diary was published in 1947, it has been reprinted and republished in multiple editions throughout the decades all with different typographic choices. I have chosen two of them to look at today.

The yellow Anne Frank book is a Kindle edition that was published in 2010 by Anchor. "The Diary of a Young Girl" is written in a very timid script font that is not set typeface as far as I can see, but actually handwritten as opposed to *The Diary of a Bookseller*. That makes it perhaps even more intimate as it gives us associations to reading a real diary, which it is, but before it was typeset and published for millions of people to read. However, as it is not standard typeset letters they might be a bit more difficult to read. 

The red edition is a mass market paperback that was published by Bantam in 1993. Here the title is written in a much more formal typeface with serifs that is also much easier to read than the other edition. It's also a bit contrasted and has a very low descender line compared to the baseline, which means that even though the "Y" is written as a lowercase letter it needs to be the same size as the other letters to make it consistent. I'd also say the width is slightly extended, but not very, which makes it more airy and again contributes to the more formal tone. It is much less personal than the other two books discussed, and is perhaps marketed more as a historical account rather than a young girl's personal diary.
