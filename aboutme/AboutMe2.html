    Hello, and welcome to Booktypes! 
</p>

<p>
    My name is Maud Haugland, I'm a 20-year-old girl from Drammen, Norway, just a short train journey from Oslo.
    Norway is a country of very long, dark and cold winters with lots of snow, and a people that likes to keep 
    to themselves, curled up in their own homes which they have tried to make as cosy as possible. 
    And what's more cosy than reading a good book by the fireplace after a long ski trip through the forest? 
    (Maybe watching Tour de Ski on TV while eating heart-shaped waffles, but I won't go too Norwegian on you). 
</p> 

<p>
    I'm currently in my second year studying Media, Journalism and Publishing at Oxford Brookes University.
    After I graduate I hope to go into the book publishing industry, although I haven't figured out exactly what 
    role I want to pursue yet. I do hope that it will contain international relations in some shape or form as I
    think cultural exchange through literature is both extremely fascinating and important.
</p>

<p>
    As you have probably figured out by now, I am a booklover. I enjoy reading books, 
    reading about books, buying books and looking at books. The last one is basically what this blog is about, 
    me looking at books and telling you about the typography of their titles. On this site you will only see 
    books that I have read and enjoyed or are very interested in reading myself, so feel free to take them as 
    recommendations too. 
</p>


<h3>Some of my favourite books:</h3>

<ul>
    <li> The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman</li>
    <li> Normal People by Sally Rooney</li>
    <li> The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern</li>
    <li> Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami</li>
    <li> Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen</li>
</ul>

<p>
    However, my life isn't just about books, even though it might seem like that sometimes. I also enjoy knitting, drinking lots of tea, 
    listening to music (mostly film soundtracks and Norwegian pop), and playing the alto saxophone.
    Depending on the season I try to go hiking and cross country skiing through the forests and over the mountains
    as often I can to clear my head, actally get some exercise and fresh air while being surrounded by nature.
