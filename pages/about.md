### Concept

They say that one should never judge a book by its cover right? Well, here at *Booktypes* I will judge books by the typography on their covers. Their titles to be more exact. We get a lot of information by looking at the cover of a book, and that includes the design of the text: the typography. Do they match the expectations of the genre? What does the typography give away about the story within? Are there some general trends, and how have they changed over time? These are some of the things I will explore with this blog. 

### Logo

I made the logo using Adobe InDesign, and since I am basically judging books, I thought I should incorporate a bookish element of some kind. And what is more bookish than an actual book? Even though I am technically judging the typography on the book *cover*, I thought the open book would be more recognisable as an actual book and not just a rectangle of some kind. In the middle I have put a big capital B for *Booktypes* in a sort of stamped circle. The B is set in a font called Luminari, which is high contrasted and serifed, so it looks a bit old fashioned, but because of the soft endges and round shapes it doesn't look as serious as some other fonts of similar typefaces. The dark teal colour also softens up the image from the stark contrasts of black and white which would have made it look too much like a company's website, like a library, and newspaper-like. 

### Branding

The banner image was chosen because it included books *and* their titles in different kinds of fonts and designs. I also included the blog's subtitle, the concept boiled down to a sentence: "Judging book covers by their typography", which I think will make the reader understand right away what they are looking at. These are not book reviews, but book cover typography analyses. I also tried to use some of the colours in the banner image throughout the rest of the blog too. It is kind of light and airy with some green tones that go well with the logo.
